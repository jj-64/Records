\title{Approximated Distribution of number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
NT_DTRW_approx(m, T)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the number of records we are computing its probabolity (integer)}

\item{T}{length of the series (integer)}
}
\value{
a probability less than one
}
\description{
Approximate distribution of the number of records in DTRW model. The function computes the probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T}.
}
\details{
The probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T} is given by:
\deqn{ P(N_T = m) = \frac{e^{\frac{-m^2}{4T}}}{\sqrt(\pi T)} }
where  \eqn{T} is the length of the process

NT_DTRW_approx(m=1,T=25)
