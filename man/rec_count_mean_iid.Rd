\title{Exact Expected number of records in Classical Model}
\usage{
rec_count_mean_iid(T, approx = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{numeric, the length of the series}

\item{approx}{logical, if approximated value. default = FALSE}
}
\value{
a single value of the expected number of records
}
\description{
The average expected number of records in an i.i.d process. It is distribution-free,
i.e. independent from the process underlying distribution. It only depends from the length of the series.
}
\details{
It is \eqn{E(N_T) = \sum_{1}^{T}\frac{1}{t}} where \eqn{T} is the length of the series
If approximated, as the sum of \eqn{1/t} can be approximated by \eqn{log(T) + \omega} where \eqn{\omega = 0.577215} is euler mascheroni constant
}
\examples{
rec_count_mean_iid(T=25)
# 3.815958
rec_count_mean_iid(T=25, approx = TRUE)
# 3.796091
