\title{Approximated Expected number of records in Classical Model}
\usage{
ENT_iid_approx(T)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{the length of the series}
}
\value{
a single value of the expected number of records
}
\description{
The average approximated expected number of records in an i.i.d process. It is distribution-free, i.e. independent from the process underlying distribution. It only depends from the length of the series.
}
\details{
As the sum of \eqn{1/t} can be approximated by \eqn{log(T) + \omega} where \eqn{\omega = 0.577215} is euler mascheroni constant
