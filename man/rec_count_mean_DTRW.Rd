\title{Exact Expected number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T, approx = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{numeric, the length of the series}

\item{approx}{logical, if approximated value. default = FALSE}
}
\value{
a single value of the expected number of records
}
\description{
The average exact expected number of records in a DTRW process. It is distribution-free, i.e. independent from the process underlying distribution.
It only depends from the length of the series.
}
\details{
It is computed as \eqn{E(N_T) = (2T +1) \times 2^{-2T} \times C_{T}^{2T}} where \eqn{T} is the length of the process
If approximated, it is computed as \eqn{E(N_T) = \sqrt(4T/\pi)} where \eqn{T} is the length of the process
}
\examples{
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T=25)
# [1] 5.726034
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T=25, approx = TRUE)
# [1] 5.641896
