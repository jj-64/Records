\title{Exact Expected number of records in Classical Model}
\usage{
rec_count_mean_iid(T)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{the length of the series}
}
\value{
a single value of the expected number of records
}
\description{
The average expected number of records in an i.i.d process. It is distribution-free, i.e. independent from the process underlying distribution. It only depends from the length of the series.
}
\details{
It is \eqn{E(N_T) = \sum_{1}^{T}\frac{1}{t}} where \eqn{T} is the length of the series
