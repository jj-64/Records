\title{Compute Log-Likelihood for different models}
\usage{
Likelihood_Xt(x, params, process, dist)
}
\description{
Computes the log-likelihood of independent and identically distributed (IID)
variables based on full information of the series, and under different
underlying distribution.
For more info on each model, look at
\code{\link{Likelihood_Xt_iid}}
\code{\link{Likelihood_Xt_DTRW}}
}
\examples{
Xt = VGAM::rfrechet(n=50, shape = 1, scale = 2)

Yt = DTRW_series ( 50, dist = "norm", mean = 0, sd = 1)
