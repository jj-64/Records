\title{Variance of number of records in Classical Model}
\usage{
VNT_iid(T)
}
\value{
a value of the variance of number of records
}
\description{
The variance of number of records in classical model.
}
\details{
It is computed as
\eqn{V(N_T) = \sum_{1}^{T} 1/t - \sum_{1}^{T} 1/t^2}
where T is the length of series
}
\examples{
VNT_iid(T=25)
[1] 2.210235
ENT_iid(T=25)
[1] 3.815958
For a series of length 25 and following a classical model, we expect to observe around 3.81 records with a variance of 2.21
NT_iid(m=1,T=25)
