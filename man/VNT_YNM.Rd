\usage{
VNT_YNM(T, gamma)
}

\item{T}{the length of the series}

\item{gamma}{The power of the process, \eqn{\gamma >= 1}}
}
\value{
a single value of the variance of number of records
}
\description{
The variance of number of records in a YANG-Nevzorov process.
}
\details{
A YNM-Nevzorov process can be expressed as
\deqn{X_t = max\{Y_1, \cdots, Y_{\gamma^t}\}}
where \eqn{t} is the time, \eqn{Y_t} are idenpendent and identically distributed random vector.

In fact, \eqn{F_{X_t}(x) = \{F_{Y_t}(x)\}^{\gamma^t}}, where \eqn{F(.)} is the cumulative distribution function

The variance of number of records is computed as
\deqn{V(N_T) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} P_t - \sum_{t=1}^{T} (P_t)^2}

where \eqn{P_t =  \frac{\gamma^t (\gamma -1)}{\gamma  (\gamma^t -1)}}
