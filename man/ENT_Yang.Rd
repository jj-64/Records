\title{Expected number of records in YANG-Nevzorov process}
\usage{
ENT_Yang(T, gamma)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{the length of the series}

\item{gamma}{The power of the process, \eqn{\gamma >= 1}}
}
\value{
a value for the expected number of records
}
\description{
The expected number of records in a Yang-Nevzorov process. It is distribution free, i.e. does not depend on the underlying distribution of the process.
}
\details{
A Yang-Nevzorov process can be expressed as
\deqn{X_t = max\{Y_1, \cdots, Y_{\gamma^t}\}}
where \eqn{t} is the time, \eqn{Y_t} are idenpendent and identically distributed random vector.

In fact, \eqn{F_{X_t}(x) = \{F_{Y_t}(x)\}^{\gamma^t}}, where \eqn{F(.)} is the cumulative distribution function

The expected number is computed as
\deqn{E(N_T) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{\gamma^t (\gamma -1)}{\gamma  (\gamma^t -1)}}
}
