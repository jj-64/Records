\title{Approximated Distribution of number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
rec_count_dist_DTRW(m, T, approx = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the number of records we are computing its probabolity (integer)}

\item{T}{length of the series (integer)}

\item{approx}{logical, if approximated value. Default = FALSE}
}
\value{
a probability less than one
}
\description{
Exact and approximate distribution of the number of records in DTRW model.
The function computes the probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T}.
#' @details
The Exact probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T} is given by:
\deqn{ P(N_T = m) = 2^{-2T+m-1} \times C_{T}^{2T-m+1} }
where  \eqn{T} is the length of the process
}
\details{
The approximated probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T} is given by:
\deqn{ P(N_T = m) = \frac{e^{\frac{-m^2}{4T}}}{\sqrt(\pi T)} }
where  \eqn{T} is the length of the process
}
