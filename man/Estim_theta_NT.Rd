\title{Estimation of \eqn{\theta} in LDM Process Based on Number of Records}
\usage{
Estim_theta_NT(X)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector representing the time series data.}
}
\value{
A numeric estimate of the parameter \eqn{\theta}.
}
\description{
Estimates the parameter \eqn{\theta} in the Linear Drift Model (LDM) process using
the number of records.
}
\details{
An LDM process is defined as:
\deqn{ X_t = Y_t + \theta t, }
where \eqn{Y_t} are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables.
The properties are studied when \eqn{Y_t} follows a \eqn{Gumbel(\alpha, \beta)} distribution.

The estimation formula is given by:
\deqn{ \hat{\theta} = -\log\left(1 - \frac{N_T}{T} \right) }
where \eqn{N_T} is the number of records observed in the process \eqn{X_t}, and \eqn{T} is the length of the process.

This estimator is known to be biased, and a bias-corrected version is provided in
\code{\link{Estim_theta_NT_unbiased}}.

\examples{
Yt <- rnorm(25)
Xt <- Yt + 0.2 * (1:25)
rec_counts(Xt)  # Number of records
Estim_theta_NT(X = Xt)
