\title{Distribution of number of records in Classical Model}
\usage{
NT_iid(m, T, s = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{Integer. The number of records whose probability is to be computed.}

\item{T}{Integer. The length of the series.}

\item{s}{Optional. The Stirling number of the first kind, \eqn{s(T,m)}. If not provided,
it will be computed internally.}
}
\value{
A probability value (numeric) less than or equal to 1.
}
\description{
Exact distribution of the number of records in classical model. The function computes the probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T}.
}
\details{
Computes the exact probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T},
given by:
\deqn{ P(N_T = m) = \frac{s(T, m)}{T!} }
where \eqn{s(T, m)} is the unsigned Stirling number of the first kind.
}
\examples{
NT_iid(m = 1, T = 25)
# [1] 0.04

NT_iid(m = 2, T = 25)
# [1] 0.1510383

NT_iid(m = 2, T = 25, s = Stirling_first_kind(n = 25, k = 2))
# [1] 0.1510383
