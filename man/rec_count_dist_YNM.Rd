\title{Distribution of number of records in YANG-Nevzorov (YN) process}
\usage{
rec_count_dist_YNM(m, T, gamma, s = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the observed number of record}

\item{T}{the length of the series}

\item{gamma}{The power of the process, \eqn{\gamma >= 1}}

\item{s}{Optional. Precomputed Stirling matrix from
\code{\link{Stirling_2nd_YNM}} (default = NA so it is recomputed internally).}
}
\value{
Probability value \eqn{P(N_T = m)} less than one
}
\description{
Distribution of the number of records YANG-Nevzorov (YN) process. The function computes the probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T}.
}
\details{
A YNM-Nevzorov process can be expressed as
\deqn{X_t = max\{Y_1, \cdots, Y_{\gamma^t}\}}
where \eqn{t} is the time, \eqn{Y_t} are idenpendent and identically distributed random vector.

In fact, \eqn{F_{X_t}(x) = \{F_{Y_t}(x)\}^{\gamma^t}}, where \eqn{F(.)} is the cumulative distribution function

It is computed as \eqn{P[N_T=m] = \gamma^{-T} * s[T,m] / \prod_{t=1}^{T} u_t }

where \eqn{u_t = \frac{1-\gamma^t}{\gamma^t (1-\gamma)}}

\eqn{T} is the length of the process, \eqn{\theta} is the LDM slope, \eqn{\beta} is the scale parameter of the \eqn{Gumbel} distribution
