\title{Record Rate at Finite Time for DTRW Process}
\usage{
PT_DTRW(t)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Integer time step \code{t >= 1}.}
}
\value{
Numeric, probability that time \code{t} is a record.
}
\description{
Computes the probability that an observation at time \code{t} is a record in a discrete-time random walk (DTRW) process.
This function uses the survival probability of a symmetric random walk.
}
\details{
This is the exact finite-time record rate, based on the survival probability of the walk.
It is equal to the survival probability. See (\code{\link{Survival}})
