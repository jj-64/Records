\title{Distribution of number of records in LDM process}
\usage{
rec_count_dist_LDM(m, T, theta, scale = 1, s = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{the observed number of record}

\item{T}{the length of the series}

\item{theta}{the LDM parameter, slope \eqn{\theta > 0}}

\item{scale}{(optional, 1 by default) the scale or \eqn{\beta} parameter of the \eqn{Gumbel} distribution}

\item{s}{(NA by default) the Stirling matrix of the seconf kind}
}
\value{
a probability less than one
}
\description{
Distribution of the number of records in LDM model with \eqn{Gumbel} underlying distribution. The function computes the probability of observing \eqn{m} records in a process of length \eqn{T}.
}
\details{
An LDM process is defined as \eqn{X_t = Y_t + \theta t },
where \eqn{Y_t} are independent and identically distributed random variable.
The properties are studied when \eqn{Y_t} follow a \eqn{Gumbel(\alpha, \beta)} distribution.

It is computed as \eqn{P[N_T=m] = e^{\theta \times T / \beta} * s[T,m] / \prod_{t=1}^{T} u_t }

where \eqn{u_t = e^{-\theta/\beta} \times \frac{(1-e^{-\theta t/\beta})}{(1-e^{-\theta/\beta})}}

\eqn{T} is the length of the process, \eqn{\theta} is the LDM slope, \eqn{\beta} is the scale parameter of the \eqn{Gumbel} distribution
