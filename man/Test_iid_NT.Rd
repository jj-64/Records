\title{Classical i.i.d. Test Based on Record Counts}
\usage{
Test_iid_NT(X, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric vector of observations.}

\item{alpha}{Significance level (default = 0.05).}
}
\value{
A list with:
\item{stat}{The observed test statistic.}
\item{p_value}{The p-value under the null hypothesis.}
\item{dec}{Character string: "Classical" or "NO"}
}
\description{
Tests whether a sequence of observations is i.i.d. based on the number of records,
following the test statistic proposed by Arnold.
}
\details{
The test statistic is:
\deqn{Z_T = \frac{N_T - \log(T)}{\sqrt{\log(T)}}}
where \eqn{N_T} is the observed number of records in the sample of size \eqn{T}.

Under the null hypothesis (i.i.d.), \eqn{Z_T} approximately follows a standard
normal distribution.

The decision rule:
\itemize{
\item Reject H0 (NO) if \eqn{p\_value < \alpha}.
\item Otherwise, fail to reject H0 (classical i.i.d.).
}

\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)
