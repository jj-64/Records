\title{Generate a Discrete-Time Random Walk (DTRW) Series with Normal Noise}
\usage{
DTRW_series_Norm(T, mean, sd)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{Integer. The length of the series.}

\item{mean}{Numeric. The mean (location) parameter of the normal distribution.}

\item{sd}{Positive numeric. The standard deviation of the normal distribution.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the DTRW series.
}
\description{
Generates a DTRW series where the increments follow a Normal distribution.
}
\details{
The series is generated recursively as:
\deqn{x_t = x_{t-1} + e_t, \quad e_t \sim \mathcal{N}(\text{mean}, \text{sd})}
where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{T} is the length of the series.
\item \eqn{e_t} are i.i.d. random variables from a Normal distribution.
\item \eqn{\text{mean}} is the mean of the Normal distribution.
\item \eqn{\text{sd}} is the standard deviation of the Normal distribution.
}
}
\examples{
DTRW_series_Norm(100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
