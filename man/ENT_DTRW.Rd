\title{Exact Expected number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
ENT_DTRW(T)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{the length of the series}
}
\value{
a single value of the expected number of records
}
\description{
The average exact expected number of records in a DTRW process. It is distribution-free, i.e. independent from the process underlying distribution. It only depends from the length of the series.
}
\details{
It is computed as \eqn{E(N_T) = (2T +1) \times 2^{-2T} \times C_{T}^{2T}} where \eqn{T} is the length of the process
