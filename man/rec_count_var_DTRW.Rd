\title{Variance of number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
rec_count_var_DTRW(T, approx = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{numeric, the length of the series}

\item{approx}{logical, if approximated value. default = FALSE}
}
\value{
a value of the variance of number of records
}
\description{
The approximated variance of number of records in DTRW model.
}
\details{
Exact variance is computed as
\eqn{V(N_T)= 2T+2-E(N_T)-E(N_T)^2}
where \eqn{T} is the length of series and \eqn{E(N_T)} is the expected number
of records in DTRW process

Approximated variance is computed as
\eqn{V(N_T)_approx = 2T \times (1-\frac{2}{\pi})}
}
\examples{
rec_count_var_DTRW(T=25, approx = TRUE)
# [1] 18.16901
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T=25, approx = TRUE)
# [1] 5.641896
rec_count_var_DTRW(T=25, approx = FALSE)
# [1] 13.4865
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T=25, approx = FALSE)
# [1] 5.726034
# For a series of length 25 and following a DTRW model, we expect to observe
# around 5.62 records with an approximated variance of 18.169
