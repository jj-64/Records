\title{Variance of number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
VNT_DTRW(T)
}
\value{
a value of the variance of number of records
}
\description{
The exact variance of number of records in DTRW model.
}
\details{
It is computed as
\eqn{V(N_T)= 2T+2-E(N_T)-E(N_T)^2}
where \eqn{T} is the length of series and \eqn{E(N_T)} is the expected number of records in DTRW process
}
\examples{
VNT_DTRW_approx(T=25)
[1] 18.16901
ENT_DTRW_approx(T=25)
[1] 5.641896
VNT_DTRW(T=25)
[1] 13.4865
ENT_DTRW(T=25)
[1] 5.726034
For a series of length 25 and following a DTRW model, we expect to observe around 5.72 records with an approximated variance of 13.48
