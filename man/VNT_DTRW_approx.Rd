\title{Variance of number of records in DTRW Model}
\usage{
rec_count_var_DTRW_approx(T)
}
\value{
a value of the variance of number of records
}
\description{
The approximated variance of number of records in DTRW model.
}
\details{
It is computed as
\eqn{V(N_T)_approx = 2T \times (1-\frac{2}{\pi})}
where T is the length of series
}
\examples{
rec_count_var_DTRW_approx(T=25)
[1] 18.16901
ENT_DTRW_approx(T=25)
[1] 5.641896
rec_count_var_DTRW(T=25)
[1] 13.4865
rec_count_mean_DTRW(T=25)
[1] 5.726034
For a series of length 25 and following a DTRW model, we expect to observe around 5.62 records with an approximated variance of 18.169
